  <h1>About the Project</h1>

  <p>Hello! My name is Krystian and I'm the owner of WebDev, a boutique software company. I work as a full-stack developer and technical development lead in a large online printing company. I'm also a passionate runner and data enthusiast.</p>

  <p>Together with my personal coach – a professional trainer and sports rehabilitation specialist – I’m developing a prototype application that integrates with the Garmin Connect API. The goal is to help me better understand my performance metrics, recovery trends, and training efficiency.</p>

  <p>In the future, this tool may evolve into a solution to support other athletes coached by my trainer.</p>

  <p>Check out a short video of one of our training sessions:
